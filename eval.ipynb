summary)"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":["0 Nigel McCune from the Musicians' Union said British musicians are \"disadvantaged\" compared to their US counterparts.A US Embassy spokesman said: \"We are aware that entertainers require visas for time-specific visas and are doing everything we can to process those applications speedily.\"The Musicians' Union stance is being endorsed by the Music Managers' Forum (MMF), who say British artists face \"an uphill struggle\" to succeed in the US, thanks to the tough visa requirements, which are also seen as impractical.Musicians' groups are to tackle US visa regulations which are blamed for hindering British acts' chances of succeeding across the Atlantic.\"The US is the world's biggest music market, which means something has to be done about the creaky bureaucracy,\" says Mr McCune.\"The current situation is preventing British acts from maintaining momentum and developing in the US,\" he added.A singer hoping to perform in the US can expect to pay $1,300 (£680) simply for obtaining a visa.\n","1 But they still want more.They have to want to be the biggest band ever and not stop wanting it.The band have done \"everything in their considerable powers\" to ensure they remain the biggest band in the world, according to Q magazine editor Paul Rees.We don't want to be thought of as a veteran band.\"\"The challenge is to be bigger and bolder and better - to make records the whole world will listen to,\" Bono recently said.U2, who have won three prestigious Grammy Awards for their hit Vertigo, are stubbornly clinging to their status as one of the biggest bands in the world.The end of the decade marked a crucial point for the band - they had reached the top but still yearned for new challenges and achievements.They are, perhaps, alone as the only rock band that has got better with age.\"They also have to want it.In 1987, The Joshua Tree broke sales records and saw the band reach the height of their powers with hits including Where the Streets Have No Name, I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For and With Or Without You.The stadium-filling, anthemic sound was U2's aim from the start, and their third album, War, saw them make the breakthrough on both sides of the Atlantic, going to number one in the UK and 12 in the US.He added: \"They are equally determined to push themselves to make music that continues to stand up.Their new album, How To Dismantle An Atomic Bomb, comes 28 years after the schoolfriends got together in Dublin and 17 years after The Joshua Tree cemented their place on the all-time rock A-list.These came in the form of explorations of different branches of rock and forays into electronic dance music, plus wildly extravagant stage shows, while still trying to retain their mass appeal.Vertigo, the first single from the new album, went straight into the UK singles chart at number one, knocking Eminem off the top spot and giving them their 26th top 10 hit.Songs like Sunday Bloody Sunday and New Year's Day brought success and an image as a political and spiritual band - which Bono rejected as a cliche.Before the release of How To Dismantle An Atomic Bomb, they had sold 125 million albums around the world.\n","2 Babyshambles, which he formed after his acrimonious departure from the Libertines, played a warm-up show at The Garage, north London, on Monday.Rock singer Pete Doherty has been involved in a fight with his band's guitarist at their biggest gig to date.On Tuesday, Doherty and his three bandmates were introduced to the crowd by Mick Jones, the former Clash guitarist who produced the Libertines' second album.On Monday Doherty faced blackmail and robbery charges in court, which he denies.Doherty, 25, had to be home by midnight to observe the curfew, which is one of the conditions of his bail.The former Libertines singer traded blows with guitarist Patrick Walden.Babyshambles played for 5,000 fans at London's Brixton Academy on Tuesday.He is out on £50,000 bail and the judge agreed to extend his 2200 GMT curfew deadline by two hours so he could play the Brixton gig.\n","3 A Series of Unfortunate Events also stars Scottish comedian Billy Connelly, while Carrey takes on a number of different roles in the surreal film.Ocean's 12 fell to number two while new entry Spanglish entered the chart at number three, taking $9m (£4.6m).A Series of Unfortunate Events, starring Jim Carrey, took $30.2m (£15.5m) in its debut weekend.Carrey entertained crowds at the UK premiere of Lemony Snicket in London on Friday.\n","4 Ocean's Twelve, the crime caper sequel starring George Clooney, Brad Pitt and Julia Roberts, has gone straight to number one in the US box office chart.The sequel narrowly beat its 2001 predecessor, Ocean's Eleven which took $38.1m (£19.8m) on its opening weekend and $184m (£95.8m) in total.A remake of the 1960s film, starring Frank Sinatra and the Rat Pack, Ocean's Eleven was directed by Oscar-winning director Steven Soderbergh.Ocean's Twelve box office triumph marks the fourth-biggest opening for a December release in the US, after the three films in the Lord of the Rings trilogy.Soderbergh returns to direct the hit sequel which reunites Clooney, Pitt and Roberts with Matt Damon, Andy Garcia and Elliott Gould.A milder review in the New York Times dubbed the sequel \"unabashedly trivial\".\n","5 The Institute also cited the death of actor Marlon Brando and the changing landscape of TV news in the US.The AFI also questioned \"the long-term viability of evening news broadcasts\", in the light of 24-hour news channels and the internet.The list also acknowledges key influences and trends in the world of film and broadcasting.In referring to Marlon Brando's death on 1 July at the age of 80, the 13-strong AFI jury concluded \"the art of screen acting has two chapters - 'Before Brando' and 'After Brando'.It its place, the AFI fears, is a news landscape where \"newscasters are more personalities than journalists\" and balance and integrity are increasingly ignored.The American Film Institute (AFI) hailed Mel Gibson's biblical epic and Michael Moore's political documentary as inspiring national debate.\n","6 Mr Wass was also given a curfew and told to surrender his passport.Mr Doherty, 25, was arrested following an alleged incident in a London hotel on Wednesday evening.A lawyer representing Mr Doherty and Mr Wass said outside court the pair strenuously denied the charges.Magistrates imposed a range of bail conditions on Mr Doherty including a curfew between 2200 and 0700, except when he attends a drug rehabilitation centre.Singer Pete Doherty will have to spend the weekend in jail because he could not come up with £150,000 bond money for his bail on time.Mr Doherty left The Libertines at the end of June 2004, but continued performing with his band Babyshambles.\n","7 Meet the Fockers also broke the box office records for the most money taken on New Year's Eve, when it made $12.2m (£6.2m), and New Year's Day, when it took $18m (£9.4m).It took $19.1m (£9.9m) on Christmas Day alone, the highest takings on that day in box office history.Comedy Meet The Fockers has held on to the number one spot at the North American box office for a second week.However, Christmas takings were down 26.5% on 2003's figures - which was blamed on Christmas falling over a weekend this year.The success of Meet the Fockers could help produce record box office revenue for 2004, said Paul Dergarabedian, president of the industry's tracker Exhibitor Relations.It took $42.8m (£23.7m) at the weekend, making its overall takings more than $163m (£90m) in 12 days, according to studio estimates.\n","8 New York band Scissor Sisters have won a gig of the year award for their performance at this year's V Festival.The award was voted for by listeners of Virgin Radio, which compiled a top 10 which was mostly dominated by newcomers on the music scene this year.Glasgow's Franz Ferdinand earned a place at number nine for their home-town performance in April.At number seven was Oxfam's Make Fair Trade gig at London's Hammersmith Apollo in October, which featured performances by REM, Razorlight and Coldplay's Chris Martin.\n","9 He played a much more serious, sensitive role in his next major film, Donnie Brasco, where he portrayed an undercover cop infiltrating a mafia ring.But it was TV that first made Depp a star.Johnny Depp, whose latest role was Peter Pan creator JM Barrie in Finding Neverland, is celebrated as one of Hollywood's most maverick talents.In 1984 he started his film career playing a doomed teenager in horror film Nightmare On Elm Street.The theme of children's literature in Depp's career - and his long association with Tim Burton - are set to continue in his next role, playing Willy Wonka in a remake of Roald Dahl's classic Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.Another role under Burton, Ed Wood, starred Depp as the crazed cult film-maker Wood, in 1994.Depp has become an unlikely major star, given his preference for taking dark and idiosyncratic roles instead of surefire box office hits.Two years later he played a soldier in Oliver Stone's Vietnam epic Platoon.His latest role in Finding Neverland explored JM Barrie's relationship with Sylvia (Kate Winslet) and her children.He has had a long-running working relationship with the equally unconventional director Tim Burton.\n","10 The film - a mix of live action and animation - will be Roberts' first project since the birth of her twins, Hazel and Phinnaeus, two months ago.An animated version was made in 1973 but this will be the first live action film.Actress Julia Roberts will play the part of a spider in a new film version of children's classic Charlotte's Web.Oprah Winfrey will voice a goose, John Cleese will voice a sheep and Steve Buscemi a rat in the 2006 film.\n","11 The UK Film Council said the drop was partly due to 2003 being an especially good year for British film production, when Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason, Wimbledon and Thunderbirds were all filmed in the UK.It was \"too early\" to predict whether the downward trend in UK production would continue throughout 2005, the UK Film Council said.Last year the government closed tax loopholes that many film investors had taken advantage of to fund films in the UK.Twenty-seven British films were made in the UK last year following a drop in funding, compared with 45 in 2003, according to the trade weekly.The number of British films produced in the UK fell 40% in 2004, with movies starring Johnny Depp and Jude Law among those affected, Screen Daily has said.It is also due to announce a replacement for UK film tax relief scheme Section 48 in July.The strength of the pound against the dollar is expected to have resulted in a fall in the number of US films shot in the UK during 2004, Screen International added.\"The reduction in indigenous film production in 2004 was due to a variety of factors, including the continuing long-term trend towards co-production of films in more than one country and changes to financing arrangements.\"\n","12 Rock star Patti Smith has been made artistic director of this year's Meltdown festival, to be held at London's South Bank Centre in June.Last year's Meltdown festival, directed by the ex-Smiths star Morrissey, included appearances by singer Jane Birkin, Nancy Sinatra and playwright Alan Bennett.\"It is important we explore the new, but we should also salute the best art there is, aesthetically and spiritually,\" she said.He also persuaded punk band The New York Dolls to reform for a reunion show.\n","13 The debut album, which took the best British album title at the Brits on Tuesday, moved up seven places from number eight to number one.Last week's number one album Tourist, by Athlete, fell to number three.There are currently six re-released Elvis' tracks occupying spots in the top 40 singles chart including Are You Lonesome Tonight at number 20, It's Now or Never at number 27 and Jailhouse Rock at number 37.Their self-titled album moved from 13 to number four.The track, from their current album How To Dismantle An Atomic Bomb, pushed Eminem's Like Toy Soldiers from number one to number three.\n","14 The independent film festival will feature two new international cinema competitions, during its 20-30 January season in Utah.International films will be given the same prominence as US films at next year's Sundance Film Festival, with movies dominated by the theme of war.Twelve films competing in the new world cinema documentary category focus on countries and people under siege.The 16 films competing in the new world cinema dramatic category include works from Germany, South Korea, Angola, China, Denmark and Australia.The Liberace of Baghdad features an Iraqi pianist hiding in a hotel as he waits for a visa, while Finnish film The Three Rooms of Melancholia looks at the war in Chechnya.Forty-two films will debut at Sundance, including The Liberace of Baghdad by British director Sean McAllister.\n","15 The woman said she was assaulted after a recording of the Jimmy Kimmel Live TV show on the ABC network in 2003.ABC said the claims had \"no merit\".The rapper's spokesman said the allegations were \"untrue\" and the woman was \"misusing the legal system as a means of extracting financial gain\".US rapper Snoop Dogg has been sued for $25m (£13m) by a make-up artist who claimed he and his entourage drugged and raped her two years ago.The woman waited two years to sue because she was trying to negotiate a settlement with the media companies, her lawyer, Perry Wander, said.The rapper's spokesperson said: \"Snoop will have the opportunity to prove in a court of law that [the alleged victim] is opportunistic and deceitful.\n","16 Film star Robert De Niro has returned to the top of the North American box office with his film Hide and Seek.De Niro recently spent three weeks at the top with comedy Meet The Fockers, which was at number five this week.Oscar best-picture nominee Sideways entered the top ten for the first time in its 15th week of release.Clint Eastwood's Million Dollar Baby led the Oscar hopefuls with $11.8m (£6.3m), coming in at number three during its first weekend of wide release.The Aviator, a film biography of Howard Hughes that leads the Oscar field with 11 nominations, was at number six for the weekend with $7.5m (£4m).Last week's top film, Ice Cube's road-trip comedy Are We There Yet?, slipped to second place with $17m (£9m), while Coach Carter fell two places to number four, taking $8m (£4.25m) in its third week.\n","17 Considine is also nominated for a best supporting actor award for My Summer of Love.Joining Vera Drake and Dead Man's Shoes in the running for best film are My Summer of Love, climbing documentary Touching the Void and zombie comedy Shaun of the Dead.Shane Meadows and Kevin McDonald, both former winners of the Douglas Hickox Award (for Best Directorial Debut) won best director nominations.Also in the running for a clutch of awards are My Summer of Love and the stalker drama Enduring Love.Mike Leigh's award-winning abortion drama Vera Drake has scooped seven nominations at this year's British Independent Film Awards.The Australian star faces competition from Daniel Craig (Enduring Love), Phil Davis (Vera Drake), Ian Hart (Blind Fight) and Dead Man's Shoes' star Paddy Considine.But the Venice winner faces stiff competition from Shane Meadows' critically acclaimed Dead Man's Shoes, which received eight nominations.\n","18 Indian film director Mira Nair has said she was thrilled to be given the chance to make William Makepeace Thackeray's novel Vanity Fair - as the book has been a favourite through her life.But Nair said that her film had picked up on the way Thackeray - who was born in India but moved to England as a young man - had seen the world.\"First, when I was 16, it was Becky Sharp, who is a completely memorable character, because I recognised myself in her - I recognised all the ladies who did not want to be ladies, who wanted to buck the system that they were in,\" she said.\"It was serendipity really - I was offered Vanity Fair by the studio Focus Features, who had distributed Monsoon Wedding,\" Nair told BBC World Service's Masterpiece programme.Nair also defended her decision to cast an American actress - Reese Witherspoon - as Becky Sharp, despite the fact that all the rest of the cast are British or Irish.But Nair said that, though this had created the need for some filming tricks, it had in fact also helped the film.The film has a new ending, with Becky Sharp running off for a new life in India.Nair said that she jumped at the chance to work on the film, which she has - controversially - made in a Bollywood style, including two song-and-dance routines in the film's second half.\"As I got older and read it, I think it was Thackeray's clarity - his clear-sightedness about his own society, the fact that he was born in India but came to England as a young man - that gave him the eyes of an outsider, and yet he was an insider.\"It was a self-fulfilling prophesy - when I first met her husband [actor Ryan Philippe], I said 'knock her up, won't you, I need some flesh on the girl',\" she joked.This was, for me, about Becky Sharp being, eventually, a full-blown woman through the course of the film.The book is one of the classics of English literature - the story of scheming 19th Century social climber Becky Sharp, played in the film by Reese Witherspoon.\"They offered me their next-best thing, not realising that Vanity Fair had actually been one of my favourite novels since I was 16 years old in an Irish Catholic boarding school in India.\"\"I cast intuitively - in my films I cast as many non-actors as I cast actors,\" she said.\n","19 The film was never shown in any cinema in Austria and was not broadcast on television until the early 1990s.The musical is based on the true story of the von Trapp family who formed a singing troupe and escaped from Nazi-occupied Austria in 1938.Sensitivities about Nazism during wartime Austria and issues towards the von Trapp family themselves could explain Austria's reluctance to embrace the musical.The original stage production of The Sound of Music is to be performed for the first time in the Austrian capital, 40 years after the film was released.The song was actually an invention by Rodgers and Hammerstein.\n"],"name":"stdout"}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"I_NRH9KcAl4A","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1608320160035,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":1087,"user":{"displayName":"Mitchell
